# üîß What We Can Do Next

NoiseLab is already functional with identification, addition, and description of image noise models, but there‚Äôs still a lot of room for improvements and enhancements. If you‚Äôd like to contribute, here are some directions we think would make the project stronger:

---

### 1. Anscombe Transform for Poisson/Photon Noise

- **Why**: Poisson and Photon noise have variance proportional to the mean, making traditional denoisers less effective.
- **What to do**: Implement a **variance-stabilizing transform (Anscombe transform)** before denoising, and an inverse transform afterwards.
- **Impact**: Improves accuracy of NLM/Wavelet filters on low-light imaging and photon-limited data.

---

### 2. Advanced Speckle and Rayleigh Filters

- **Why**: Current wavelet-based solution works, but classical filters are better suited for speckle noise.
- **What to do**: Add implementations of **Lee, Kuan, and Frost filters** for Gamma (speckle) and Rayleigh noise.
- **Impact**: Brings results closer to research-standard filtering used in radar, SAR, and ultrasound imaging.

---

### 3. Adaptive Median for Salt-and-Pepper Noise

- **Why**: Regular median works fine for low impulse density but fails with heavy noise.
- **What to do**: Implement **adaptive median filtering**, where window size increases adaptively until impulse detection is resolved.
- **Impact**: Better edge preservation and robustness against high-density impulse noise.

---

### 4. Multiplicative Noise (Speckle) Improvements

- **Why**: Current Wiener filter is only a simple approximation.
- **What to do**: Implement a **logarithmic transform** to convert multiplicative noise into additive form, then apply NLM or wavelet denoising.
- **Impact**: Cleaner suppression of speckle noise in ultrasound and radar images.

---

### 5. Quantization Noise Reduction

- **Why**: Current solution uses smoothing.
- **What to do**: Add **error diffusion dithering** (e.g. Floyd‚ÄìSteinberg) to mask quantization artifacts before smoothing.
- **Impact**: More natural-looking images when dealing with limited bit-depth scenarios.

---

### 6. Richer Educational Content

- **Why**: Descriptions are text-only right now.
- **What to do**:

  - Add **illustrative images and diagrams** showing each noise type and its PDF.
  - Expand Noise Descriptions with equations, probability density plots, and example images.

- **Impact**: Makes the app more educational for students and researchers.

---

### 7. PDF Export for Descriptions

- **Why**: Users can only view descriptions in the app.
- **What to do**: Add a button in _Noise Descriptions & Education_ tab to **download all noise descriptions as a PDF** (with equations, text, and images).
- **Impact**: Enables easy offline reference and teaching material.

---

### 8. Image Downloads for Users

- **Why**: Currently, users can only view noisy/denoised results inside the app.
- **What to do**: Add **download buttons** for each image (original, noisy, denoised).
- **Impact**: Users can save results for reports, research, or classroom demonstrations.

---

### 9. Add Histograms for Visual Analysis

- **Why**: Seeing just the images can sometimes hide subtle noise effects. Histograms give a clear picture of how pixel intensities are spread.
- **What to do**:

  - For each mode (_Noise Identification & Removal_ and _Noise Addition & Filtering_), display histograms of the **Original**, **Noisy**, and **Denoised** images.
  - Use `matplotlib.pyplot.hist` or `cv2.calcHist` for each channel.
  - Show them below the image comparison in a side-by-side layout.

- **Impact**: Great for beginners to understand how noise modifies image distributions and how filters restore them.

### 10. Add Sample Images via Assets Folder (with Noise-Relevant Examples)

- **Why**: New users may not have images ready, and educators may want quick demos without uploading files. Some noise types (e.g., Salt-and-Pepper vs. Poisson) are better demonstrated on different image types.
- **What to do**:

  - Create an `assets/` folder in the GitHub repo containing a variety of open-source test images (e.g., Cameraman, Lena, Peppers, a dark night image for Photon noise, a radar-like texture for Speckle noise, smooth gradient for Quantization noise).
  - In the app, add a **dropdown menu** (‚ÄúUse Sample Image or Upload Your Own‚Äù).
  - If ‚ÄúSample‚Äù is chosen, load the relevant image. Optionally, **auto-suggest the best demo image per noise type**. For example:

    - Salt-and-Pepper ‚Üí Lena (faces show impulse clearly)
    - Photon/Poisson ‚Üí Dark low-light scene
    - Quantization ‚Üí Smooth gradient image
    - Speckle/Rayleigh ‚Üí SAR/radar texture image
    - Gaussian/Uniform ‚Üí Any natural image

  - Let advanced users still manually pick any sample image.

- **Impact**: Makes NoiseLab usable out-of-the-box, **optimized for teaching**, where each noise type is shown on the image that highlights its characteristics best.

## üìå Contribution Guidelines

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Add your new noise model, filter, or feature inside the relevant module (`noise_identification.py`, `noise_addition_filtering.py`, or `noise_descriptions.py`).
- Test thoroughly with multiple images before submitting a pull request.
- Document your changes in the README and provide a sample demo image if possible.

üöÄ With these improvements, NoiseLab can evolve from a teaching prototype into a **comprehensive toolkit for noise modeling, filtering, and education** in image processing.
